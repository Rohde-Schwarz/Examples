Author: Jahns_P
Version Number: 3
Date of last change: 2020/10/08
Requires: HMC8015, FW 1.403 or newer and adequate options
- Installed RsInstrument Python module 1.7.0.37 or newer
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Description: Setup measurement and log to a file for a certain time, transfer the log file to the PC


General Information:

Please allways check this example script for unsuitable setting that may
destroy your DUT befor connecting it to the instrument!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information has been
compiled with care. However errors can not be ruled out. 

Please find more information about RsInstrument at

(ressource, True, True, "SelectVisa='rs'") has the following meaning:
(VISA-resource, id_query, reset, options)
- id_query: if True: the instrument's model name is verified against the models 
supported by the driver and eventually throws an exception.   
- reset: Resets the instrument (sends *RST) command and clears its status syb-system
- option SelectVisa:
			'SelectVisa = 'socket' - uses no VISA implementation for socket connections - you do not need any VISA-C installation
			'SelectVisa = 'rs' - forces usage of Rohde&Schwarz Visa
			'SelectVisa = 'ni' - forces usage of National Instruments Visa
