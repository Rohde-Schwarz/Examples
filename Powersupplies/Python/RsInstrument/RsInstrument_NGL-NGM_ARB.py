# GitHub examples repository path: Powersupplies/Python/RsInstrument

Created on 2023/04

Author: Customer Support / PJ
Version Number: 1
Date of last change: 2023/04/12
Requires:
- R&S NGM / NGL FW 04.00 or newer
- Option K102 (for SNÂ° < 110000) for remote control
- Option K103 for Digital Trigger I/O
- A trigger source (e.g. Arduino board with "Blink" example), if not available use *TRG command as described below
- Trigger source must be connected to PIN 8 (GND) and PIN 3 (TRIGGER IN) of the SUB-D15 Digital I/O connector
- Installed RsInstrument Python module (see https://rsinstrument.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Description: Initiate Instrument, define ARB sequence, let it run once, change to stepped triggered mode


General Information:
This example does not claim to be complete. All information has been
compiled with care. However, errors can not be ruled out.

sleep(9)  # Wait for nine seconds for the arb sequence to be done two times and have 1 additional second for a pause
ngm.write('OUTPut:STATe OFF')  # Sequence is done, switch output off

# Now use stepped trigger to run the ARB sequence with external signal (Triggers on both rising and falling edge!).
# The specified voltages are 0 V to 15 V for all input pins.
# As an alternative to the external trigger signal the same setup can be used for software trigger.
# Soft trigger is initiated by sending the "*TRG" command to the instrument.
ngm.write('ARBitrary:TRIGgered:MODE SINGle')  # A single trigger event only starts one step of the sequence
ngm.write('ARBitrary:TRIGgered:STATe ON')  # Change ARB to triggered mode
ngm.write('TRIGger:SEQuence:IMMediate:SOURce DIO')  # Trigger source now is DIO
ngm.write('TRIGger:SEQuence:IMMediate:SOURce:DIO:PIN IN')  #
ngm.write('ARBitrary 1')  # Activate ARB for CH1 again
ngm.write('TRIGger:STATe 1')  # Enable the trigger system
ngm.query_opc()  # Check for operation complete
ngm.write('OUTPut:STATe ON')  # Switch on the output and start the ARB sequence
sleep(30)  # let it run for 30 seconds
ngm.write('OUTPut:STATe OFF')  # Sequence is done, switch output off
