Author: Jahns_P
Version Number: 1
Date of last change: 2022/02/03
Requires: NRX, FW 02.50.21112602 or newer , adequate sensor and signal source
- Installed RsInstrument Python module (see the attached RsInstrument_PythonModule folder Readme.txt)
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Description: Example for single triggered measurement with marker support

General Information:

Please always check this example script for unsuitable setting that may
destroy your DUT or instrument before connecting!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information has been
compiled with care. However errors can not be ruled out.

'''
(resource, True, True, "SelectVisa='rs'") has the following meaning:
(VISA-resource, id_query, reset, options)
- id_query: if True: the instrument's model name is verified against the models 
supported by the driver and eventually throws an exception.   
- reset: Resets the instrument (sends *RST) command and clears its status syb-system
- option SelectVisa:
    - 'SelectVisa = 'socket' - uses no VISA implementation for socket connections - you do not need any VISA-C installation
    - 'SelectVisa = 'rs' - forces usage of Rohde&Schwarz Visa
    - 'SelectVisa = 'ni' - forces usage of National Instruments Visa
