This Python example shows how to deal with S - parameters. The S2P file must be converted and uploaded to the
sensor using either the "S2P Wizard" or "S-Parameter Update Multi" tools. Both are part of the NRP Toolkit.
The NRP Toolkit can be downloaded from our website, for example at https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/software/nrp-t-tn/.
The script will list the available files and select one for measurements.

Preconditions:
- Installed RsInstrument Python module from pypi.org
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 7.2.3 or newer

Tested with:
- NRP18T, FW v02.50.23042601
- Python 3.12
- RsInstrument 1.60.0
