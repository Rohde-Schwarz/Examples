This Python example shows how to capture IQ sample files using the R&S NRQ6 as receiver.
The script will perform two captures and in particular record the timing.

Preconditions:
- Installed RsInstrument Python module from pypi.org
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 7.2.x or newer

Tested with:
- NRQ6, FW V02.40.23032501
- Python 3.12
- RsInstrument 1.60.0

Author: R&S Product Management AE 1GP3 / PJ

Before running, please always check your setup!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information have been
compiled with care. However, errors canâ€™t be ruled out.
