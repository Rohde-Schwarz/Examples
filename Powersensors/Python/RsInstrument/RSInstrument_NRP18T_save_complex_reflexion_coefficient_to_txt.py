This Python example shows how extract the complex reflection coefficient data from an NRP power sensor to a TXT file.
It is based on the frequency information of the calibration data stored to the sensor.
The needed frequency data can be saved using the S-Parameter Update Multi tool form the NRP toolkit package:
- Start the S-Parameter Update Multi tool
- Sensor / Load Calibration Data
- Choose your sensor and click the "Upload" button followed by "OK"
- Options / Show Cal. Data
- Scroll down to "Absolute Calibration Data"
- Mark all the lines containing frequency information in this section
- Copy it with <CTRL>-C
- Open a file explorer and generate a folder called "tempdata" in drive C:
- Generate a new text document called "frq_list.txt" and paste the data using <CTRL>-P
- Save the text file

Preconditions:
- Installed RsInstrument Python module from pypi.org
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Tested with:
- NRP18T, FW v02.50.23042601
- Python 3.12
- RsInstrument 1.70.0
