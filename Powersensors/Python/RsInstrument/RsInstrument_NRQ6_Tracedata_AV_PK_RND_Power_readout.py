This Python example shows how to get the average, peak and random (sample) value from an NRQ6 trace measurement.
Please find some important information about how to deal with the sample rate in the comment lines at the measurement
section.

Preconditions:
- Installed RsInstrument Python module from pypi.org
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Tested with:
- NRQ6 FW 03.30.24121801

Author: R&S Product Management AE 1GP3 / PJ
Updated on 28.02.2025
Version: v1.1

Technical support -> https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/support

Before running, please always check your setup!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information have been
compiled with care. However, errors canâ€™t be ruled out.
