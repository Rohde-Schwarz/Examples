This Python example shows how to deal with command completion using an R&S NRPxx power sensor or the R&S NRX.
Each part of the example performs a zero calibration followed by a single measurement.

Preconditions:
- Installed pyvisa Python module from pypi.org
- Installed VISA e.g. R&S Visa 5.12.x or newer

Tested with:
- NRP18SN, FW v02.50.2303250
, NRX, FW 02.60.24032102
- Python 3.12
- PyVISA 1.14.1

Before running, please always check your setup!
This example does not claim to be complete. All information have been
compiled with care. However, errors canâ€™t be ruled out.
